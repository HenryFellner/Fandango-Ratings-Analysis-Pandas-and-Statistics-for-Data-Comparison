# Fandango-Ratings-Analysis-Pandas-and-Statistics-for-Data-Comparison
This projects looks at data from movie site Fandango. They previously inflated ratings on their site. Are they still doing so?

A writer found that Fandango inflates the rating of different movies, either by accident or to make movies appear better for the sake of having people purchase tickets to see said movies on their site.

This analysis uses new datasets to see if they are still inflating that data or not, and uses Python visualizations to do so, in a tidy succinct project.
